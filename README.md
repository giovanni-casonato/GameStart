# This is GameStart
Made for the Database System class final project.

Creators: Giovanni Casonato, Luigi Albano

The idea:
Make a website for a company that sells videogames GameStart (yes, the name is as original as the whole project)
and link the database from SQL (not in this repo) to the html page.

Comments:
I took the code for the website from a free online source and trimmed out all the .js and stuff that I did not know/understand.
Luigi and I worked on the ER Diagram and he created the Database on MySQL and entered the touples. He did more on the back-end I did more on the front-end. 
To link the website pages and SQL I opted for the Flask application and I have to say, after the first 5 hours of struggle and panic it was pretty intuitive.

Work hours:
15-20
(I don't know about Luigi's but probably 5-10)


Results:
The presentation in class was fun, and our project was definetly the most complex, user friendly, and intuitive to use.
